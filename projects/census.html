			<h3>01. Problem</h3>
			<p>Although small businesses account for over 50% of non-farm GDP and compose over 99% of all businesses, they are the most difficult to count in the Economic census. From focus groups conducted by the Economic directorate, it is clear that many small businesses do not understand the value that the Census Bureau provides and that most importantly, if the Census Bureau could communicate its value, they would be more inclined to respond.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="body-wrapper bottom-space">
			<h3>02. Task</h3>
			<p>Our goal was to communicate the value of Census Bureau data to small businesses. This included two parts:</p>
			<p>I. Design an audience-centered space on census.gov for small businesses</p>
			<p>II. Demonstrate a methodological, repeatable process for creating future audience-centered pages</p>
			<p>I conducted qualitative user research to better understand our small business users using a repeatable process.</p>

			<h3>03. Approach</h3>
			<p>I conducted qualitative user research to better understand our small business users using a repeatable process:</p>

			<h3>04. Wireframes</h3>
			<p>From our user research, qualitative analytics, and content strategy, I quickly created low-fidelity mockups of site pages. I also worked with another fellow to determine what kind of content to include and to create a site map.</p>

			<h3>05. Development</h3>
			<p>Development was tricky because we were working on a project in the federal government. I wrote about my experience <a class="link-button" href="https://blog.codingitforward.com/tech-is-easy-government-is-not-a37d38fae80e#33c4" target="_blank">here</a>, but to briefly summarize, the main challenges were:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lack of an agreed-upon digital style guide or design standards</li>
				<li>Conflicting development libraries from different departments</li>
				<li>IT-controlled main site that would require weeks to run security checks</li>
				<li>Inter-departmental conflict over who controlled the website content</li>
				<li>Difficulty in aligning stakeholders across directorates</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the end, we chose to design and develop a site that had no constraints in order to demonstrate what census.gov could look like without so much political conflict. I decided to use the <a class="link-button" href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Web Design Standards</a> created by USDS in order to align my project with the rest of the government agencies. The standards use SASS and Bourbon Neat as the building blocks, and gulp to automate the workflow. In a two-week sprint I developed the site and shipped an MVP in order to have a week left to test traffic.</p>
