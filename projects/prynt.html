			<h3>01. Background</h3>
			<p>Prynt Co. is a startup in San Francisco that creates an instant printer for your phone. Each printed photo can also be scanned using an app to reveal a hidden video.</p>
			<p>At the time, the entire shop process took place on a single page because backend development did not permit retention of shopping information between pages.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="body-wrapper bottom-space">
			<h3>02. Main Challenges</h3>
			<p>I learned that the most difficult part about designing for the web is not technical, but collaborative. With so many moving parts and with the webpage being the front-facing identity of the company, it is imperative to consider and balance the priorities of each stakeholder. For this project, the main challenges were:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Design to facilitate use of Materialize framework</li>
				<li>Display all relevant information while improving conversion</li>
				<li>Reduce number of clicks</li>
				<li>Permit A/B testing</li>
				<li>Focus on key item while still allowing customers to easily browse other accessories</li>
				<li>Decide to display items by product or by individual color SKU</li>
				<li>Consider all use cases and error messaging</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

			<h3>03. Solutions</h3>
			<p>The redesign required a high-level overview of the new architecture of the site. Using Sketch I drew out wireframes of how the new shop page would both integrate into the already existing website but also how the new multi-page shop section would dwell on the page.</p>
			<p>One of the most difficult challenges was deciding how to address different customer purchasing paths, specifically on the main item page when choosing an option on the drop down menu. Prior to the redesign, customers experienced frustration when they could not find their option. I converted this frustration into a marketing opportunity, allowing customers to opt into a subscription email when their option became available again.</p>

			<p>Another key decision was how to structure the checkout process. We decided to use the standard checkout bag icon in the top-right of the navigation as an omnipresent cart and decided to use a clean slide-out cart instead of a solitary cart page. Following this clean design to reduce number of clicks, we implemented a one-page checkout process.</p>

			<h3>04. Takeaways</h3>
			<p>Attention to detail is crucial when working with contractors. Although we designed the wireframes and indicated design guidelines, ultimately contractors developed the new site. We learned this early on in the process and learned to provide detailed guidelines for each specification.</p>
			<p>What works for one company or many companies may not work for everyone. For instance, instead of viewing several key items on one continuous page, we altered the purchasing experience to include a main page for each key item to give them equal weight of importance. This also provided the option to display and emnphasize navigation messages for wanted purchasing behavior.</p>
