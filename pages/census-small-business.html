				<h1>problem</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>
				Although small businesses account for over 50% of non-farm GDP and compose over 99% of all businesses, they are the most difficult to count in the Economic census. From focus groups conducted by the Economic directorate, it is clear that many small businesses do not understand the value that the Census Bureau provides and that most importantly, if the Census Bureau could communicate its value, they would be more inclined to respond. 
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="header">
				<h1>task</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>
				Our goal was to communicate the value of Census Bureau data to small businesses. This included two parts:
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="emph">I. Design an audience-centered space on census.gov for small businesses</span>
				</p>
				<p><span class="emph">II. Demonstrate a methodological, repeatable process for creating future audience-centered pages
				</span></p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section">

				<h1>approach</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>
				I conducted qualitative user research to better understand our small business users using a repeatable process:
				</p>
				<p></br>01  Identify goal of research</p>
				<p>02  Formulate questions</p>
				<p>03  Interview users strategically</p>
				<p>04  Create personas</p>
				<p>05  Inform design decisions</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<div class="header">
				<h1>01 identify goal of research</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>First we identified the goal of our research. Broadly speaking, it was to better understand our small business users. From that goal branched a series of other questions and behaviors we wanted to understand, like what are they looking for? What are their challenges? We wanted to develop a full characterization of our user.</p>

			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<div class="header">
				<h1>02 Formulate questions</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>Next when formulating questions to ask our users, we wanted to make sure that each question mapped to a specific goal; in other words, we wanted to make sure we were both asking meaningful questions and achieving the goals we set out earlier.</p>
				<div class="img"><img src="img/census-small-business/ppt-2.png"></div>

		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<div class="header">
				<h1>03 Strategically interview users</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>We chose to interview three different audiences to understand our users from multiple perspectives: 5 intermediares, 3 small businesses, 2 stakeholders from the Economic directorate who work on products for small businesses.</p>
				<p></br>For example we talked to 5 intermediaries, or people who aren’t small businesses but work directly with small businesses on a daily basis, like the SBA, MBDA and our own Data Dissemination Specialists. We wanted to understand at a broader picture what common questions they get asked, or resources they point small businesses to.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<div class="header">
				<h1>04 Create personas</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>After conducting 20+ hours of user research we created personas for three types of businesses based on their different challenges and needs. We then created journey maps to understand what our different users were looking for, what their answer looked like, and how to capture them. </p>
				<div class="img"><img src="img/census-small-business/ppt-4.png"></div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<div class="header">
				<h1>05 Inform design decisions</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>Finally we used our research to inform our design decisions.</p>
				<div class="img"><img src="img/census-small-business/ppt-5.png"></div>

		<div class="section">
			<div class="header">
				<h1>Wireframes</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>From our user research, qualitative analytics, and content strategy, I quickly created low-fidelity mockups of site pages. I also worked with another fellow to determine what kind of content to include and to create a site map.</p>

			<div class="header">
				<h1>development</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>Development was tricky because we were working on a project in the federal government. I wrote about my experience <a href="https://blog.codingitforward.com/tech-is-easy-government-is-not-a37d38fae80e#33c4" target="_blank">here</a>, but to briefly summarize, the main challenges were:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Lack of an agreed-upon digital style guide or design standards</li>
					<li>Conflicting development libraries from different departments</li>
					<li>IT-controlled main site that would require weeks to run security checks</li>
					<li>Inter-departmental conflict over who controlled the website content</li>
					<li>Difficulty in aligning stakeholders across directorates</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In the end, we chose to design and develop a site that had no constraints in order to demonstrate what census.gov could look like without so much political conflict. I decided to use the <a href="https://standards.usa.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Web Design Standards</a> created by USDS in order to align my project with the rest of the government agencies. The standards use SASS and Bourbon Neat as the building blocks, and gulp to automate the workflow. In a two-week sprint I developed the site and shipped an MVP in order to have a week left to test traffic. </p>
