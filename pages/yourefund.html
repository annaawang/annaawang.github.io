				There is no easy way for an international shopper to get a refund on their sales tax. Currently, international shoppers must bring all necessary documents to a Customs Broker, who takes a large cut of the refund.
				</p>
				<p>
				YouRefund seeks to simplify the experience, allowing users to get more of their refund on their own from their phone.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

				<h1>my role</h1>

			<div class="body">
				<p>
				I was put in charge of translating the concept into a deliverable user experience and of the iOS design. Due to time constraints, the business lead took charge of the android design. This turned out to be a good idea because we realized that although the main flow could stay the same, some elements needed to be different since android users and iOS users are accustomed to different design standards.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<div class="header">
				<h1>approach</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>
				First I laid out the flow using sketches. To begin, we decided that the most important aspect of this app needed to be simplicity: The ease of using the app alone should convince users to use YouRefund instead of going to a CLB like before. From the sketches, it became clear that thwere were three main activites that users would initiate: 
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Get Verified: Users provide documentation to be verified as an international shopper</li>
					<li>Create a New Refund: Users submit pictures of receipts, items, and travel information</li>
					<li> Cash Out: Users cash out their available YouRefund balance to their preferred account</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<div class="header">
				<h1>one: get verified</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>
				The key for this step was to balance our goal of simplicity with federal necessity.
				</p>
				<p>
				Initially, the verification step included seven steps with a main screen in case users wanted to leave the app and return. This was too many, and we realized that having so many steps would deter users from completing verification. I removed the main verification screen and shortened it to three steps, only keeping what was essential: Basic Information, International IDs, and a Signature as agreement to a disclaimer. 
				</p>
				<div class="img"><img src="img/yourefund/verification.png"></div>
				<p>
				We had to decide how a user would move from one verification step to the next. Initially we considered a swiping motion with tabs but quickly changed to an inactive (grey) Next button that only turned active (blue) once the user completed all necessary information. We decided that using a Next button would be more intuitive for users since swiping motions are usually reserved for displaying information rather than inputting information.
				</p>
				</p>
				<div class="img"><img src="img/yourefund/verification-2.png"></div>
				<p>
				Since users must first be verified before actually receiving any refunds, we initially decided that users should be asked to get verified immediately upon onboarding. My teammate decided that we should allow users to be able to create refunds without getting verified, but that these refunds would not be materialized until they chose to get verified.
				</p>
			</div>

		<div class="section">

				<h1>two: create a new refund</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>
				This is where simplicity was the most difficult to maintain, and where good UX could make or break the product.
				</p>
				<p>
				At first we decided that the flow would be linear just like step one. However, after more research our business lead realized that we would need to instead create a looping process to add multiple receipts per new refund. I chose to create a receipt "Home" which the user would return to after adding each receipt.

			<div class="header">
				<h1>three: cash out</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>
				Although the hamburger menu is controversial we decided to still use it, determining that it would be best to follow existing practices of well-known apps like Venmo. This way, we could have an easy location for users to access other non-essential information, like cashing out and settings.

				As one of my first experiences with UX design, I took so much away from this experience. This was my first exploration of the difference between UI and UX design. As such, I learned the importance of sketching and wireframing, and most of all that it is crucial to finalize wireframes at the mockup stage and to only start building when the entire structure is agreed upon.
				</p>
				<p>
				I also learned the importance of testing hypotheses. We made many key assumptions in the creation of our product. If the product continued, we would have liked to validate these hypotheses: 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Users are dissatisfied by Customs License Brokers</li>
					<li> Users purchase more than $100.00 from each store they visit</li>
					<li> Users come to America to shop often enough to keep the app on their phone</li>
					<li>Users want to see a history of past refunds</li>
					<li>Users will submit pictures of confidential information</li>
					<li>Users do not want to know how much YouRefund is taking out of the total sales tax</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				Finally, I learned that while each team member contributed to the final product, clearly defined roles and responsibilities set at the beginning were helpful in establishing points of contact and helped the product move forward, faster.
